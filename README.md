# Project Description:

The purpose of this project is learning to make critical decisions through theory and practice of reengineering the source code of a selected system. In doing so, the project studies the maintainability (as defined by the ISO/IEC 25010 Standard) of the selected system.  

The source code of systems1 that have proven to be useful also tend to be modified relatively frequently for some purpose, including enhancements. These modifications can lead to deterioration of quality2, specifically, deterioration of maintainability and/or deterioration of (space and/or time) efficiency.
